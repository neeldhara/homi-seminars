    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract\nThis talk explores the system of mental calculation known as “Vedic Mathematics,” based on principles derived from ancient Indian mathematical texts. We’ll examine how these techniques provide elegant and efficient methods for arithmetic, algebra, and geometry, and discuss their pedagogical value in contemporary mathematics education.\n\n\nAbout the Speaker\nDr. Amartya K Dutta is a Professor at the Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata. His research interests include commutative algebra, algebraic geometry, and the history of Indian mathematics. He has published extensively on both modern mathematical topics and historical Indian mathematical traditions.\n\n Slides\n\n\n\nRecording"
